Project Description: AmazonDB is a comprehensive database project designed to model and analyze e-commerce sales data, inspired by Amazon's sales and fulfillment structure. This project demonstrates the full lifecycle of database development, from data cleaning and schema design to query optimization and performance benchmarking.

Key Features: Data Processing: Cleaned and transformed a raw dataset of 128,976 records into a structured dataset of 120,350 high-quality records using Python.

Database Design: Implemented a normalized relational schema with three core tables (orders, products, shipping) using PostgreSQL.

Query Optimization: Developed and optimized SQL queries for business insights, with a focus on performance tuning using indexing and statistics.

Performance Benchmarking: Evaluated query execution times under three scenarios (no optimization, with statistics, and with indexes + statistics), achieving a 37% performance improvement.

Business Insights: Generated analytical reports on sales trends, product performance, customer behavior, and regional sales.

Technologies Used: Database: PostgreSQL

Programming Languages: SQL, Python (for data cleaning)

Tools: pgAdmin, Google Colab, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

Repository Structure: Data Cleaning: Python scripts for preprocessing and handling missing values.

Schema Design: DDL statements for table creation and relationships.

Data Insertion: DML scripts for populating the database.

Analysis Queries: SQL scripts for business use cases and performance testing.

Documentation: Project report detailing methodology, findings, and conclusions.

This project serves as a practical example of database design and optimization, providing valuable insights into e-commerce data analytics and scalable system performance.
